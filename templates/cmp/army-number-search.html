<h2> British Army Number Search Tool</h2>

{% include 'navbar.html' %}

<p>
This search tool can match army numbers from the 1920's to the end of World War 2 which was based on the regiment that a soldier joined initially, and the post war numbering system which is army wide. Pre 1920's, soldiers had regimental numbers so this site cannot be used for matching those. More about army number can be found in this <a href="https://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/soldiers/a-soldiers-life-1914-1918/new-british-army-numbers-issued-in-1920/">article</a>.
A search for the number <b>7875698 </b> should return <i>Royal Tank Regiment</i>. It is the number assigned to <a href="https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=123584">T.E. Lawrence</a> who joined the Tank Corps in March 1923.

Enter an army number to find out which regiment block the number was assigned from (upto WW2) or approximately when the soldier joined the army (post WW2).
